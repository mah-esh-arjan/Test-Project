Quiz 1: Dynamic Updates with Objects
You are managing a cart state that looks like this:

javascript
Copy code
const [cart, setCart] = useState({});
Task:
Add a product to the cart with a unique id.
Prevent adding the same product twice; if it already exists, update its quantity instead.
Example item:

javascript
Copy code
const item = { id: 101, name: "Laptop", price: 1000, quantity: 1 };
Hint: Use item.id as the key.

Quiz 2: Manipulate Arrays in State
You are managing a cart state that is an array:

javascript
Copy code
const [cart, setCart] = useState([]);
Task:
Add a product to the cart.
Remove a product by its id.
Update the quantity of a product in the cart by its id.
Example items:

javascript
Copy code
const product1 = { id: 1, name: "Phone", price: 800, quantity: 1 };
const product2 = { id: 2, name: "Tablet", price: 600, quantity: 1 };

Quiz 3: Prevent Overwriting
You have the following cart state:

const [cart, setCart] = useState({});
Task:
Write a function to add a product to the cart. Ensure that:

The cart keeps all existing products.
Each product is stored under a unique key (e.g., its code).
If a product with the same code is added, it overwrites the existing one.
Example item:
javascript
Copy code
const item = { code: "USD", name: "Rubles", rate: 96 };
const item3 = { code: "USD", name: "US Dollar", rate: 85 };
const item2 = { code: "EUR", name: "EUR Dollar", rate: 77 };


Quiz 4: Conditional Rendering
You are building a shopping cart UI. The state structure is:

javascript
Copy code
const [cart, setCart] = useState([]);
Task:
Create a button to add items to the cart.
Display a "Cart is Empty" message if the cart is empty.
Otherwise, list all items with their names and quantities.


Quiz 5: Combining State Changes
You are managing a combined state:

temp = {name : "test"}

javascript
Copy code
const [state, setState] = useState({
  user: { name: "Mahesh", loggedIn: false },
  cart: [],
});
Task:
Write a function to log the user in and update their name.
Write a function to add items to the cart.


Advanced Challenge: Nested Updates
You are managing a cart where each product has additional details, such as:

javascript
Copy code
const [cart, setCart] = useState({
  1: { name: "Laptop", quantity: 1, price: 1000 },
  2: { name: "Phone", quantity: 2, price: 800 },
});
Task:
Write a function to increase the quantity of a product by its id.
Write a function to calculate the total price of the cart.
